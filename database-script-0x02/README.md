## Overview
This file seeds the Airbnb database with realistic sample data, simulating:

- **Users**: Guest, Host, and Admin
- **Properties**: Two listings owned by the host
- **Bookings**: One confirmed, one pending
- **Payments**: Linked to confirmed booking
- **Reviews**: Feedback from guest on both properties
- **Messages**: A guest-host conversation

## Purpose
The sample data enables testing of queries, joins, and relational constraints in a real-world-like environment.
